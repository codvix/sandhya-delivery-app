## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables Added:
1. **AdminNotification** - For restaurant admin notifications
2. **UserNotification** - For customer notifications

### Key Features:
- **Persistent storage** - All notifications stored in database
- **User isolation** - Each user only sees their notifications
- **Read status tracking** - Proper mark as read functionality
- **Automatic cleanup** - Limits to prevent database bloat

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Admin Notifications (`/api/admin/notifications`)
- `GET` - Fetch all admin notifications
- `POST` - Create new admin notification
- `PUT` - Mark notification(s) as read
- `DELETE` - Clear all admin notifications

### User Notifications (`/api/notifications`)
- `GET` - Fetch user's notifications
- `POST` - Create new user notification
- `PUT` - Mark notification(s) as read
- `DELETE` - Clear user's notifications

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Test the Systems

#### Admin Panel Testing:
1. Open restaurant admin panel
2. Create a test order from customer side
3. Verify notification appears in admin panel
4. Mark notification as read
5. Refresh page - notification should stay marked as read

#### Customer Panel Testing:
1. Place an order as customer
2. Change order status in admin panel
3. Verify notification appears in customer panel
4. Mark notification as read
5. Refresh page - notification should stay marked as read

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Before (Issues):**
- ❌ Notifications lost on page refresh
- ❌ "Mark as read" didn't persist
- ❌ localStorage-based (unreliable)
- ❌ No proper database structure

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Persistent notifications** - Survive page refreshes
- ✅ **Proper read status** - Mark as read works correctly
- ✅ **Database-backed** - Reliable and scalable
- ✅ **Production ready** - Proper error handling and API structure
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Still works with polling
- ✅ **User isolation** - Each user sees only their notifications
